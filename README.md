Shall I compare thee to a creationist?
--------------------------------------

While reading Anthony Flew's book 'There is a god', I came across yet another re-hashing of
Gerald Schroeder's specious argument against evolution based on monkeys and typewriters.

The argument, as presented [here](http://www.geraldschroeder.com/ScientificMyths.aspx) refering
to Shakespeare's 14th sonnet goes like this

> ... All sonnets are 14 lines, all about the same length. This sonnet has approximately 488 letters
> (neglect spaces). With a typewriter or keyboard having 26 letters, the number of possible
> combinations is 26 to the exponential power of 488 or approximately ten to the power of 690.
> That is a one with 690 zeros after it...

That is, it would take more than the lifetime of the universe (that there is a pretty big number)
to 'evolve' just one sonnet.

I have come across this argument many times, and it rankled each and every time. But this time
it was attributed, and I knew that it was coming out of the mouth of someone who should know better.

So I wrote, very quickly, some pretty grotesque ruby to show just with how little
effort this claim can be disproved.  The engine here is randomness, combined with a very strict form
of selection. Random mutations can accumulate in the proto-sonnet untill a character falls in the right
place. That character is then locked in, and then further mutations can occur on the rest of the string.
until another correct mutation takes place. Rince and repeat. This model does not take more than the
lifetime of the universe, it takes less than a minute.

Is this an accurate model of evolution? Certainly not, it is in many ways flawed.  But it is closer
than the nonsense of the 'many monkeys' argument.

If you want to highlight some of these deficiencies, go right ahead, but if you can, you will
probably already know more about evolution than Mr Schroeder.

Note
----

This is not exactly the sonnet Shakespeare wrote. It has no punctuation, caps, or newlines. I was
following Schroeders example with this, I just left the spaces in to make it more readable.
